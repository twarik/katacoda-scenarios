To deploy a model we create the following resources
- A deployment to deploy the model using TFServing
- A K8s service to create an endpoint a service
- An Istio virtual service to route traffic to the model and expose it through the Istio gateway
- An Istio DestinationRule is for doing traffic splitting.
